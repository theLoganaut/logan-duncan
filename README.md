# Welcome to my website's github!

Built with React, React-Bootstrap, and a dash of React95. 

Far from truly finished, but I wanted more experience on getting from plan to production, then servicing with CI/CD updates once its at a viewable state. 

All animations are tailored to my website, as are all images seen.

Working on making it as beautiful on mobile as it is on desktop, as well as getting the moon animation to an npm package.

Thanks for viewing!
