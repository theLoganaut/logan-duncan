# Welcome to my website's github!

Built with React, and React-Bootstrap. 

A project to showcase some of what I've learned! This time I just wanted to get a little about me from start to finish, and work on the CI/CD side of things. Currently a simple hosting on AWS Amplify through a Route 53 DNS but I plan on trying other deployment services as I update this website.

All animations are tailored to my website, as are all images seen.

Whats next?
 + Next.js implementation for SSR
 + Adding other projects I've worked on
 + Adding the Moon Animation as an NPM package
  
Thanks for viewing!
